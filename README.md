# Hubot

WARNING: This is Jolly Science's version of Hubot. It is configured for the Jolly Science environments and systems. 

## 'min'

This branch is being used to establish the base-level of functionality for JoSi. Think of this as "JoSi-lite". She handles all of the basic conversational and memory tasks, but has no complex configuration, and no dangerous access points. She is totally polite, stable, and harmless.

## 'max'

This branch will be everything that works. This is a stable, but full-featured. Dangerous, but specific. It's highly-customized to the Jolly Science environment, members, and processes. It's the library of all things JoSi. When she uses this branch, she's Cruella Deville.

## 'master'

This is the default state for JoSi. Unless otherwise directed, she should always wake up on master. So should her children.

## 'develop'

This is the branch used for the engineers behind JoSi to work on her.

## 'hubot'

This is the branch that only Hubot pays attention to.
